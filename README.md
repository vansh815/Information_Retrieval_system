# Information_Retrieval_system
 This was the subject that I took during my Bachelor's. Under this project we studied and learned various Information Retrieval methods. We used different types of pre-processing techniques such as Removal of Stop words, Tokenisation, Stemming, Lemmatisation. Tf-Idf vectorisation for encoding.We learned different types of filtering like content based ,collaborative filtering .We have also learned different types of unsupervised learning and clustering techniques. We also have done evaluation by deriving cosine similarity between the given two documents and how well are they related with each other based on the text data.
